My hope for your birthday is that it is a day that is topped with cool friends, great gifts, and awesome times! Happy Birthday, Nephew! *There are no rules around how you should have a great birthday. I'm going to leave it up to you as to how you're going to make a great birthday even better! Happy Birthday, Nephew!</p>
